        "I don't remember their being as much of a change between the games as their is between gen 2 and gen 3.  There is of course the huge upgrade to the box system.  Abbilitys and Natures are added which add a whole new dynamic to the game, and picking up berrys allong your journey is also another new mechanic.",
        "There are some difference between physical and non physical attacks that don't seem to line up with physical and special stats.  For example using fire punch on a pikachu with the static abbility might leave you paralized, but still relys on the special attack stat.",
        "The end game was also more diffucult then I remember, but that might be becasue I rushed through the ocean part of the game instead of exploring and getting lost like you are supposed to.",
        "Because I have played this game so much in the past I opted to play in a \"nuzlock style\", only catching the first pokemon I found on each route but kept using them even if they fainted.  The only exception was catching abra in the same cave after catching aaron, but I couldn't pass up an opertunity to play with an all punch Allakazam.",
        "There are some short commings for my team again, most notably against ice typing.  I also failed to include any fighting type moves, but that is much less punishing in this game.",
        "Linoone, Tropious, and Gyarados where used for access to the different HM moves, and pick up on Zigzagoon/Linoone was rediculus."
