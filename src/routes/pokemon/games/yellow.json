        "Fun fact: Pokemon yellow was the first Gameboy Color game that I ever had!",
        "Generation one is more rough then I remember, sleep, paralysis, and confusion are much more brutal then they are in later games.",
        "I also think that my team could have been better if I had planned a little better.  Maybe gone with Haunter instead of Nidoking would have given me a better type coverage (looking at you Alakazam).  I also think giving Blastoise body slam would have been smarter than giving it to Pikachu.  Then Pikachu could have used swift and Mew could have kept tri attack.",
        "For the moves that everyone does have, it is mostly for type coverage or so that I don't have to keep swapping out Pokemon to use HM's.  I wanted to make sure I had a psychic type, something that knows earthquake, and swift for when my opponents had minimized into oblivion. I was also hopping to get Venusaur to learn sleep powder, but never got to a high enough level",
        "I used the glitch at Nugget Bridge to catch mew.",
        "Lastly, I used Buterfree for flash in Rock Tunnel and to put Mew to sleep to make it easier to catch."
