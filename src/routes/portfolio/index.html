        # Basic Ideals

        The main goal for this project was being able to implement:
        1) Front End Routing
        2) Front End Rendering/Templating
        4) Dynamically Loading Html
        3) Dynamically Loading Javascript

        None of the things I ended up going with did anything innovative. Did I re-invent the wheel for this project? Yes. But it was fun learning ways to make it work.

        For this project I  did not want to interact with the window element or dom outside of the [Core Application class](https://github.com/Malotkya/Alex.Malotky.net/blob/main/src/backend/App/Core/index.ts) or code that had been loaded dynamically. I also didn't want to rely on any frameworks already out their and instead using as much of my own code as possible.  I am happy with how the base of the project has turned out,  I just need to get a little bit better at styling my project.

        ## Routing
        For routing, I wanted to replicate the middle ware structure that [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) uses. After reading through the code, I was able to eventually implement routing using layers. After struggling to figure out how to pass information back up, I took a hint from [Koa.js](https://github.com/koajs) and created a context class that is able to pass information up and down the layer stack.

        ## Rendering and Templating
        Originaly for this project I wanted to use template Html files to render the pages.  As my pages got more complex, and I wanted to show off some of the code that I used in my capstone project I decided to use pure javascript and Web Componenets.  This lead me to create modules that are compiled by webpack that will export either an HTML string, and HTML Element or a function that returns on of the previously mentioned types.  When landing on that page, the app will dynamically load the module and then render and display the page.

        # Technology

        ## Firebase
        I decided to go with firebase to host my project because it is easy to set up and deploy to.  On top of that I am also able to access firestore, which is a document database, so that I can update information on my website without having to redeploy the application.

        ## Typescript
        I decided to go with typescript over plane javascript because I wanted to have stricter typing then javascript has natively.  I thought working with typescript would be fun especially because I would already be going through the process of bundling my code with webpack.

        ## Webpack
        I wanted to use webpack to minify all of my files and copy the code into a build folder rather then have my compiled and uncompleted code next to each other.  I also felt that bundling my code into a single file would give my code the best performance results. 

        # Problems
        The have been some issues along the way.  First was figuring out routing, having used express in the past I have used middleware layout before and wanted to do something similar but front end, and ended up studying how express uses layers to iterate over the middleware. 

        Another issue that I ran into is accessing firestore adds a lot of overhead to my code that I wanted to remove as much as possible.  So I ended up loading the firebase code dynamically if i need to access firestore and caching the results to prevent further calls to the firestore database.  This also required me to add magic comments to my code that I am personally not a fan of. 

        One problem that I ran into was when I was originaly using templated html files, loading times were not great as the pages got increasingly more complex, and using javascript with the rendered html files was as easy as I thought it would be.  To combat this, I switched to using Web Components and using a single function make elements created with javascript easier to read, it looks like react at home.

<!-- Capstone Project -->
<article class="portfolio-card">
    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>

        <a href="/Decks" target="_blank">Find it Here</a> |
        <a href="https://github.com/Malotkya/CapstoneProject">Github Repo</a>

        # Background
        In order to graduate from my [Applied Computing](https://uwex.wisconsin.edu/applied-computing/#overview) program I had to complete a Capstone Project where ideally I would be working with a client (ex. an employeer or local company) and create some kind of project.  Because at the time I worked for a security company I decided to reach out to a Magic the Gathering content creater named DJ about creating a website.   I had seen him complain online that he have been running into issues with displaying the decks online and wished for a custom solution.

        # About Magic the Gathering
        Magic the Gathering is a card game with a different formats that have varying rules.  Some people just collect the cards, and other people play the game competitivly, while most just play for fun with their friends at home. I personally play a format called Commander or EDH where the decks are based around a single card that helms the deck.  Displaying the decks in this app is prioritized for displaying commander decks.

        # Requirements
        The main requirements for this project where:
        1) Being able to easily add decks that had been created in scryfall.
        2) Be able to easily view the cards in the deck without ads or unnecisary information.
        3) Being able to easily to view all the decks in a list.

        Some stretch goals were added like:
        1) Being able to search the decks.
        2) A link for downloading the decklists.
        3) A link to purchase the decklists.

        # Technology
        Wix was chosen as the platform to develop the website because it has drag and drop elements that would allow DJ to be able to make changes and maintain the website after I was no longer working on the project.
        Wix also came with the abbility to add custom elements allowing me to add special functionality and a document database for storing the deck information.

        To Npm packages were added to the project:
        1) [cvs-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parse): used for parsing cvs deck information uploaded to the database.
        3) [masonry-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/masonry-layout): used to form a masonry layout betweeen the different catagories in a deck list.
    </mark-down>
    <p>
        Unfortunatly the project never went live and I have added a modified/lite version of the code here on my portfolio website.  The deck view page is the same with some styling changes to match my website.
        The view all does not currently have any search functionality because wix's database and firebase are different enough that I had to put it off.  But it is in the works.

        # Background
        This project was the dream child of my wife.  Who thought it would be fun to be able to track rubber ducks as they move around.  For those who don't know people who drive jeeps will leave
        ducks for eachother on one anothers jeeps.  In the same vein people who go on cruises will leave ducks around the ship for others to find and share.  Both of these things are things that
        she enjoys doing so and came up with the idea for the app.
        
        When working on this project I treat it similarly to working on my capstone project.  I created a document specifiying the goals and expectations of the project and worked on it in sprints
        getting aproval during each step.

        # Requirements
        1) Be able to create an account that allows one to follow ducks and to create their own ducks.
        2) Be able to scan a qr code that links to the ducks page on the website
        3) Ability to upload pictures of the duck when the qr code is scanned or by the ducks creator.

        # Technology
        Cloudflare pages was selected to host the project because it has free/ cheep tiers for the technology required, this limited the technology we used because price was a concern.

        
        Cloudflare pages allows backend funcitons to execute on paths, and that is used to access the database.  The database is cloudflares d1 database which is an SQLite implimitation.
        Because the backend was written in typescript, I wrote the front end app as a Single page application in typescript as well that is complied using webpack.

        # Thoughts
        The project was both fun and challenging.  My sister was one of the testers for the project, and getting some of the custom elements to work in Safari was one of the more anoying hurdles.


        While I am still working on the project to polish it up. The core functions have been completed.

        Phasmophobia is a horror puzzle game where you enter a haunted house and attept to discover the type of ghost haunting the house.
        There are varying levels of difficulty where not all the evidence needed to identify the ghost are presented instead rellying on "secondary evidence".
        This app will remove ghosts from the list based on the amount of evidence that get provided and help narrow down the ghost you are trying to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this website using Typescript to create classes that interact with the dom, abstracting the logic of the website from the dom manipulation.
        Webpack is used to bundle it all together, and is hosted, like most of my projects on firebase.

        I am in the process of converting some games that I had written in vanilla javascript, notablly Yatzee and TicTacToe, in React.
        This is both a fun and difficult project as I learn to work with something that I am unfamiliar with.

    <p>
        Plainchase is a variant of Magic the Gathering where one can role a dice that will cause random effects on the game.
        After working with React for the other project, I thought it might be fun to attempt to work with react native.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of going around and finding all the cards that are involved for planechase, instead a random one can be selected.  The text for the cards will be hardcoded for if the
        app is unable to load the cards from an external service.
