        # Basic Ideals

        The main goal for this project was being able to implement:
        1) Front End Routing
        2) Front End Rendering/Templating
        4) Dynamically Loading Html
        3) Dynamically Loading Javascript

        None of the things I ended up going with did anything innovative. Did I re-invent the wheel for this project? Yes. But it was fun learning ways to make it work.

        For this project I  did not want to interact with the window element or dom outside of the [Core Application class](https://github.com/Malotkya/Alex.Malotky.net/blob/main/src/backend/App/Core/index.ts) or code that had been loaded dynamically. I also didn't want to rely on any frameworks already out their and instead using as much of my own code as possible.  I am happy with how the base of the project has turned out,  I just need to get a little bit better at styling my project.

        ## Routing
        For routing, I wanted to replicate the middle ware structure that [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) uses. After reading through the code, I was able to eventually implement routing using layers. After struggling to figure out how to pass information back up, I took a hint from [Koa.js](https://github.com/koajs) and created a context class that is able to pass information up and down the layer stack.

        ## Rendering and Templating
        Originaly for this project I wanted to use template Html files to render the pages.  As my pages got more complex, and I wanted to show off some of the code that I used in my capstone project I decided to use pure javascript and Web Componenets.  This lead me to create modules that are compiled by webpack that will export either an HTML string, and HTML Element or a function that returns on of the previously mentioned types.  When landing on that page, the app will dynamically load the module and then render and display the page.

        # Technology

        ## Firebase
        I decided to go with firebase to host my project because it is easy to set up and deploy to.  On top of that I am also able to access firestore, which is a document database, so that I can update information on my website without having to redeploy the application.

        ## Typescript
        I decided to go with typescript over plane javascript because I wanted to have stricter typing then javascript has natively.  I thought working with typescript would be fun especially because I would already be going through the process of bundling my code with webpack.

        ## Webpack
        I wanted to use webpack to minify all of my files and copy the code into a build folder rather then have my compiled and uncompleted code next to each other.  I also felt that bundling my code into a single file would give my code the best performance results. 

        # Problems
        The have been some issues along the way.  First was figuring out routing, having used express in the past I have used middleware layout before and wanted to do something similar but front end, and ended up studying how express uses layers to iterate over the middleware. 

        Another issue that I ran into is accessing firestore adds a lot of overhead to my code that I wanted to remove as much as possible.  So I ended up loading the firebase code dynamically if i need to access firestore and caching the results to prevent further calls to the firestore database.  This also required me to add magic comments to my code that I am personally not a fan of. 

        One problem that I ran into was when I was originaly using templated html files, loading times were not great as the pages got increasingly more complex, and using javascript with the rendered html files was as easy as I thought it would be.  To combat this, I switched to using Web Components and using a single function make elements created with javascript easier to read, it looks like react at home.

    <p>
        Phasmophobia is a horror puzzle game where you enter a haunted house and attept to discover the type of ghost haunting the house.
        There are varying levels of difficulty where not all the evidence needed to identify the ghost are presented instead rellying on "secondary evidence".
        This app will remove ghosts from the list based on the amount of evidence that get provided and help narrow down the ghost you are trying to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this website using Typescript to create classes that interact with the dom, abstracting the logic of the website from the dom manipulation.
        Webpack is used to bundle it all together, and is hosted, like most of my projects on firebase.

        I am in the process of converting some games that I had written in vanilla javascript, notablly Yatzee and TicTacToe, in React.
        This is both a fun and difficult project as I learn to work with something that I am unfamiliar with.

        Plainchase is a variant of Magic the Gathering where one can role a dice that will cause random effects on the game.
        After working with React for the other project, I thought it might be fun to attempt to work with react native.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of going around and finding all the cards that are involved for planechase, instead a random one can be selected.  The text for the cards will be hardcoded for if the
        app is unable to load the cards from an external service.

        Over the Fall Semester of 2022 and the Spring Semester of 2023, I had the privilage of working with DJ (the Jumbo Commander) in making a new website.
        He opted to host his new website with <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> that comes with a drag and drop edditor.
        This was important for DJ because he wanted the ability to update and make changes to the website without needing to rely on someone else.
        Wix also comes with the ability to create custome elements and a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using those features I was able to create a way for DJ to easily store Magic the Gathering deck information within the database, allowing for users to search through the database, and also easily view the decks and cards within the database.
        It was a challenging project because working within the confines of Wix caused some hurdles, but in the end I am happy with how it turned out.
