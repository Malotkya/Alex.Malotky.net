        This website is an attempt at showing off my ability to create a front end applicaiton using vanilla javascript,
        or more accuratly Typescript.  There is a little bit of reinventing the wheel, but I wanted as much of this website
        as possible to be my own code.  The only things that aren't are the functions used to access Google's firestore database
        and some of the code that is generated by webpack when it is compiling my typescript.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website works with a class that disables the browsers main functions when clicking links in the navbar and loading content
        from a router.  The router can either hold static content or load content from another HTML file.  The router also has the ability
        to load javascript into a script tag and execute it after the HTML has been inserted into the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last thing that I added to the website was the ability to template an html file.  I chose two brackets to be used to insert a variable into the page. Ex:
        <pre>\{\{ variable \}\}</pre>
        With this method I could introduce functions that could call other template pages and loop over arrays, but I still wasn't satisfied.  I ended up adding the ability
        to execute javascript code within different dilimiters opting for brackets and percent sign. Ex:
        <pre>\{\% javascript code \%\}</pre>
        This allowed me to include things like testing for a missing variable or formating a date a certain way, or looping over an array in a more clean fassion. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The functions that I have included into the rendering are:
        <ul>
            <li>For Each - That inclueded a callback that was called for each item within an array, and a callback for if the array was empty.</li>
            <li>Include - That took a string for a filename of the template to include in that location and an args variable</li>
            <li>Formate Date - that took a format string and formated a date to look nice.</li>
        </ul>

        Phasmophobia is a horror puzzle game where you enter a haunted house and attept to discover the type of ghost haunting the house.
        There are varying levels of difficulty where not all the evidence needed to identify the ghost are presented instead rellying on "secondary evidence".
        This app will remove ghosts from the list based on the amount of evidence that get provided and help narrow down the ghost you are trying to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created this website using Typescript to create classes that interact with the dom, abstracting the logic of the website from the dom manipulation.
        Webpack is used to bundle it all together, and is hosted, like most of my projects on firebase.

        I am in the process of converting some games that I had written in vanilla javascript, notablly Yatzee and TicTacToe, in React.
        This is both a fun and difficult project as I learn to work with something that I am unfamiliar with.

        This project invalves playing around with the 2D library to create/ emulate a terminal.

    <p>
        Plainchase is a variant of Magic the Gathering where one can role a dice that will cause random effects on the game.
        After working with React for the other project, I thought it might be fun to attempt to work with react native.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of going around and finding all the cards that are involved for planechase, instead a random one can be selected.  The text for the cards will be hardcoded for if the
        app is unable to load the cards from an external service.

<!-- Jumbo Commander's Website-->

        Over the Fall Semester of 2022 and the Spring Semester of 2023, I had the privilage of working with DJ (the Jumbo Commander) in making a new website.
        He opted to host his new website with <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> that comes with a drag and drop edditor.
        This was important for DJ because he wanted the ability to update and make changes to the website without needing to rely on someone else.
        Wix also comes with the ability to create custome elements and a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using those features I was able to create a way for DJ to easily store Magic the Gathering deck information within the database, allowing for users to search through the database, and also easily view the decks and cards within the database.
        It was a challenging project because working within the confines of Wix caused some hurdles, but in the end I am happy with how it turned out.
